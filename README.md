# CS 131 Spring 2023: Brewin Interpreter

Hiya! This is a series of interpreters written for the Spring 2023 CS131 Course. The language "Brewin" was created by the Professor and TAs of the course.

There are variety of features in these interpreters including:
Brewin -> Dynamic Type Checking, Operators, Methods, Classes 
Brewin++ -> Inheritance, Local Variables, Semi-Static Typing 
Brewin# -> Exception Catching and Throwing, Templated Classes (Parametric Polymorphism) 

The Interpreter was written by Victor Chinnappan. This Professor and the TAs provided the parser and a InterpreterBase class which is used to make the interpreter testable with their Autograder.

**To run tests using autograder:**
Brewin -> ```$ python3 tester.py 1```

Brewin++ -> ```$ python3 tester.py 2```

Brewin# -> ```$ python3 tester.py 3```
